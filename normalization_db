Database normalization - The process of taking a database design, and apply a set of formal criteria and rules, is called Normal Forms.

The database normalization process is further categorized into the following types:
First Normal Form (1 NF)
Second Normal Form (2 NF)
Third Normal Form (3 NF)
Boyce Codd Normal Form or Fourth Normal Form ( BCNF or 4 NF)
Fifth Normal Form (5 NF)
Sixth Normal Form (6 NF)


Normalization is a term used by database professionals for a schema design process that minimizes data duplication and enforces data integrity.

While there are many complex rules that define the process of refactoring data into various levels (or forms) of normalization,
a simple definition for practical purposes is:

1. Separate each entity into its own table.
2. Separate each discrete attribute into its own column.
3. Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a primary key.
4. Use foreign key columns to link related entities.
To understand the core principles of normalization, suppose the following table represents a spreadsheet that a company uses to track its sales.
