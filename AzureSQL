Azure SQL is the collective name for a family of relational database solutions based on the Microsoft SQL Server database engine.
Specific Azure SQL services include:

Azure SQL Database – a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) database hosted in Azure
Azure SQL Managed Instance – a hosted instance of SQL Server with automated maintenance, which allows more flexible configuration
than Azure SQL DB but with more administrative responsibility for the owner.
Azure SQL VM – a virtual machine with an installation of SQL Server, allowing maximum configurability with full management responsibility.
Database administrators typically provision and manage Azure SQL database systems to support line of business (LOB) applications
that need to store transactional data.

Data engineers may use Azure SQL database systems as sources for data pipelines that perform extract, transform, and load (ETL)
operations to ingest the transactional data into an analytical system.

Data analysts may query Azure SQL databases directly to create reports, though in large organizations the data is generally 
combined with data from other sources in an analytical data store to support enterprise analytics.
